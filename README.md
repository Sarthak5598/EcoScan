# 🌍 EcoScan - Clothing Carbon Footprint Scanner

## 📜 Overview
EcoScan is a web application designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their clothing. By uploading images of clothing items, users can see estimated carbon scores, earn eco-reward points, and redeem sustainability-focused offers. This project demonstrates a full-stack solution for a green initiative product.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Django Templates with Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Django (Python-based framework)
- **Image Recognition**: OpenAI Vision API for image processing

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eco-scan-challenge.git
   cd eco-scan-challenge
   ```

### 2. **Create and Set Up Virtual Environment using Poetry**  
   Create a virtual environment using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry init
   poetry add django
   poetry install
   ```

### 3. **Migrate the Database**  
   After setting up the virtual environment, run migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   poetry run python manage.py migrate
   ```

### 4. **Run the Application**
   - **Backend**: Start the Django backend server:
     ```bash
     poetry run python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - **Frontend**: As the frontend is served using Django templates with Bootstrap, the UI is automatically rendered by the backend.

### 5. **Testing**  
   Run the tests to verify the setup:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest   # for backend tests
   ```
