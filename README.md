# üåç EcoScan - Clothing Carbon Footprint Scanner

## üìú Overview
EcoScan is a web application designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their clothing. By uploading images of clothing items, users can see estimated carbon scores, earn eco-reward points, and redeem sustainability-focused offers. This project demonstrates a full-stack solution for a green initiative product.

## üîß Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Django Templates with Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Django (Python-based framework)
- **Image Recognition**: OpenAI Vision API for image processing

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EcoScan.git
   cd EcoScan
   ```

### 2. **Create and Set Up Virtual Environment using Poetry**  
   Create a virtual environment using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry init
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```

### 3. **Migrate the Database**  
   After setting up the virtual environment, run migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### 4. **Run the Application**
   - **Backend**: Start the Django backend server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - **Frontend**: As the frontend is served using Django templates with Bootstrap, the UI is automatically rendered by the backend.

### 5. **Testing**  
   Run the tests to verify the setup:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest   # for backend tests
   ```

## üåü Product & Technical Enhancements

In this section, suggest possible improvements that could make **EcoScan** a more effective and scalable solution.
## Future Improvements

1. **OpenAI Model Training**:
   - Train an OpenAI model for more consistent and reliable responses.

2. **Employee-Side Features**:
   - Expand functionality to improve the employee experience and manage tasks efficiently.

3. **Collaboration with Ecoscan and Reewild**:
   - Integrate food discounts based on the number of clothes donated.
   - Enable single delivery for donations and food services to streamline processes.

4. **Backend Scalability**:
   - Scale the backend to handle larger user loads efficiently. This could involve optimizing database queries, using caching mechanisms, and considering distributed systems or cloud hosting solutions.

5. **Enhanced Carbon Scoring Model**:
   - Improve the carbon scoring model by incorporating more detailed data, such as the carbon footprint of donated items, transportation logistics, and the environmental impact of various donation types.

6. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Enhance the user experience by providing additional insights, such as sustainability comparisons between different donation actions, personalized recommendations, and progress tracking.

7. **External API Integration**:
   - Integrate the solution with external APIs to provide real-time data, such as live carbon footprint statistics, donation tracking, or food availability, further enhancing the app's relevance and user engagement.
